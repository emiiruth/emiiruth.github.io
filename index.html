            <h1>YOUTUBER COMMENT GHOSTWRITING</h1>
            <h2>Fall 2020 - Summer 2021</h2>
            <p> For me, ghostwriting was an exercise in leaving behind my own identity and taking on a new voice. Learning to bend language to my will for expression so far outside of my own style gave me better control of my prose, deepened my understanding of a demographic I once found foreign
            (middle aged white women who love interior design), and instilled an acute understanding that the voices we consume on social media may not be exactly what they seem.

            <h1>LIFETIME CONCERT HISTORY</h1>
            <h2>2013 - Current</h2>
            <p>In 2013, my dad surprised me with my first ever concert: a Christian rock show in an honest to god (lol) church! The rest is history - I've been taking myself to as many shows as possible ever since (although I haven't seen any legitimate
              Christian rock since 2013 which is regrettable). Before you judge my choices, keep in mind that I was a (young) 13 in 2013, and thusly 14 and 2014, 15 in 2015, etc. I recognize that going from Neutral Milk Hotel to the Chainsmokers to Hoodie Allen to the Decemberists is insane - my only
              defense is that puberty is a confusing time for all of us.
